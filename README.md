# Africa Covid19 Genomics

This repo contains all the code, data and information needed to reproduce the analyses for the African genomic epidemiology manuscript.

All the data, scripts and figures contained in this repository are the propriety or the authors and are being shared publicly for the purpose of capacity building and training. Therefore they should not be used by third parties for any other purpose than personal learning. A manuscript presenting these results is currently underway and the data will be open for use and replication of results after publication of the manuscript.
